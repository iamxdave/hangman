<!-- HOW DOES IT WORK-->
## How does it work 📔
<p align="justify">
  The application was made based on a game [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) and following its rules.
  The game is simple, one person is choosing a password, and the other must guess it without making to many mistakes.
